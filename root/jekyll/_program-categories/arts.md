      Using the interactive [National Fine Arts Program Guide](), staff can
      guide youth through the various art projects with step-by- step
      instructions and instructional videos. A panel of distinguished judges
      selects works for inclusion in the National Fine Arts Exhibit, which is
      displayed throughout the ensuing year at BGCA events, including the annual
      National Conference.

      The [Drama Matters]() Program is a weekly program consisting of 60 minute
      sessions segmented for beginner, intermediate and advanced members. Each
      session can be adapted to fit the age of participants as well. Sessions
      consist of a short warm-up; a main activity of games, script work or
      performance; and a 10-minute cool-down. The Lessons in Stagecraft Program
      Guide includes many different ways for members to express themselves
      creatively, from costumes to set design to directing.
