                <p>
                    The Auction opens at 12:01 AM, Friday May 1, 2020 and closes
                    at 11:59 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2020. When the bidding window
                    opens all Donors and Bidders must create an account and
                    provide their credit card information before being assigned
                    a Bidding Number unique to their account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bidders can register and bid on their mobile phone, enabling
                    real time notifications regarding items they are actively
                    bidding on. Bidders can also register and bid on other
                    computer/iPad devices, but will not receive notifications;
                    instead they will have to monitor their items manually.
                    Bidders have the opportunity to purchase items without
                    bidding, by selecting the guaranteed price. Winners will be
                    notified after the auction closes at 11:59 PM on Tuesday,
                    May 5, 2020.
