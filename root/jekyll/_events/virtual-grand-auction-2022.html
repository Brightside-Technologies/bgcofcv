        <p class="h4 font-weight-bold">Before the Auction</p>
        <p>
          Items will be available to preview beginning Wednesday, May 5th at
          7:47am. The link for computer bidding and code for Text2Bid will be
          emailed out as well as posted on the BGC of CV website www.bgcofcv.org
          prior to May 5th.
        </p>
        <p class="h4 font-weight-bold">The Auction</p>
        <p>
          The Auction opens at high noon on Friday, May 7th, 2021 and closes at
          8pm Tuesday, May 11th, 2021. When the bidding window opens all Donors
          and Bidders must create an account providing their phone number and
          email information before being assigned a bidding number unique to
          their account. We accept American Express, MasterCard, Visa and Check.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bidders can register and bid on their mobile phone, enabling real time
          notifications (texts) regarding items they are actively bidding on.
          Bidders can also register and bid on other computer and tablet
          devices, but will not receive notifications; instead they will have to
          monitor their items manually. Bidders have the opportunity to purchase
          items without bidding, by selecting the guaranteed price. Auction
          winners will be notified by text and/or email after the auction closes
          at 8pm Tuesday, May 11th, 2021.

        <p class="h4 font-weight-bold">After the Auction</p>
        <p>
          Once the auction closes the items will be awarded to the highest
          bidder, unless the item has been purchased for the guaranteed price
          prior. All minimum bids and buy now pricing are good while auction is
          open. Items sold after the auction closes must be purchased for the
          amount it was sold for during the auction or the FMV.
        </p>
        <p>
          All items are sold as-is. All sales are final. There are no exchanges
          or refunds on items. However, Boys & Girls Club will refund the full
          purchase price if there is a failure of performance either on the part
          of the Boys & Girls Club or the Donor.
        </p>
        <p>
          California state sales tax will be charged when appropriate. Buyer
          will be furnished an electronic receipt at the conclusion of the sale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certificates can be mailed within 10 days if the winner provides their
          mailing address to info@bgcofcv.org. Otherwise, actual items must be
          picked up only at Boys & Girls Clubs of Coachella Valley’s
