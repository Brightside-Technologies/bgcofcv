With the vision and support of the Foster and Powell families, this clubhouse opened in 2002 and was funded in large part from a California Youth Authority grant. Located next to Bobby Duke Middle School and Palm View Elementary School in Coachella, this club hosts a variety of after-school and summer activities. Today this club still benefits from the involvement and support of the Foster and Powell children and grandchildren..
