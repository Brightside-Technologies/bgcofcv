    Each year, the Board directs Presidents Circle funding to a handful of key
    initiatives and ongoing priorities. Please see our impact report to learn
    about our initiatives and priorities from last year

    For over 50 years, the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Coachella Valley has
    accomplished its goals of opening doors and transforming lives by providing a
    safe place where young people can be themselves, be proud, and experience
    opportunities never thought possible. To make the possible possible, we depend
    on support, your support. Our funding does not come from public funds. It
    comes from private individuals and private foundations that recognize the
    value of their investment. Every gift is managed by our Board of Directors
    with the utmost fiscal responsibility, fiduciary oversight, and transparent
    financial management.


    Bound by their shared commitment to Boys & Girls Clubs of Coachella Valley,
    members of the Presidents Circle assist Board President John Powell, in
    advancing the Clubsâ€™ distinctive mission: **To save and enhance the lives of
    the young people of our community, especially those with economic and/or
    social needs by offering a safe haven and meaningful youth development
    services provided by a caring and qualified staff**.


    Members of Presidents Circle make a minimum unrestricted $1,000 cash gift
    annually. Their contributions are designated toward those immediate and
    long-term priorities that speak to BGCofCV unique calling.
