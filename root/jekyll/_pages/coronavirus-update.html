                    This page is designed to help Boys & Girls Clubs of
                    Coachella Valley members and friends updated about the
                    status of our activities, clubhouses and programs and
                    additional information to help better prepare to respond to
                    the challenges of the COVID-19 coronavirus. We all need to
                    take steps to keep ourselves and each other healthy and to
                    reduce the risk for spread of the virus. Information is
                    changing often, and updates will be made here regularly. You
                    should rely on official sources first and foremost. We will
                    repost some of that information here, in addition to BGCCV
                    status reports and updates.

                            <p>
                                During what are difficult and challenging times

                                safety, and well-being are what matter most.
                                With schools and workplace closures due to the
                                COVID-19 pandemic, our community is facing
                                challenges unlike anything previously
                                encountered. We are thinking about you and
                                remain deeply appreciative that you are part of
                                our Boys & Girls Clubs of Coachella Valley

                                        team members, Club staff is working.
                                        Some are engaged in ongoing deep
                                        cleaning of our facilities so that we’re
                                        fully ready when the time comes to
                                        re-open. Most of the Administrative
                                        staff is working remotely. We’re all
                                        committed to staying engaged with our
                                        colleagues and our Club kids and their
                                        families.

                                The virus is thought to be spread mainly from
                                person-to-person, by coming into close contact
                                with another person (within six feet) and
                                through respiratory droplets. These droplets are
                                produced when a person coughs or sneezes and
                                lands in the mouths or noses of people who are
                                nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The virus can also spread by coming in contact
                                with infected surfaces and objects. A person can
                                get the virus by touching a surface or object
                                which has the virus on it and then touching
                                their own eyes, nose, or mouth.

                                2-14 days after exposure and include fever,
                                cough, and shortness of breath. People who are
                                mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to isolate at
                                home during their illness. You should restrict
                                activities outside your home, except for getting
                                medical care. Do not go to work, school, or
                                public areas. Avoid using public transportation,
                                ridesharing, or taxis. For more information

                                As this is a new virus and products have not
                                been tested against this specific strain,
                                standard cleaning products that kill other
                                viruses will be presumptively fine against

                                disinfectants are expected to be effective in
                                disinfecting contaminated surfaces. Product
                                label instructions must be followed. The
                                strongest evidence so far indicates that
                                COVID-19 is transmitted by respiratory
                                droplets—coughs and sneezes—from infected
                                individuals. It’s not yet clear how likely
                                humans are to be infected by touching possible
                                contaminated surfaces. It is not recommended at
                                this time to do anything beyond routine cleaning
                                in your household if no one is sick.
