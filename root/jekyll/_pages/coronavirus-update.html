                    additional information to help better prepare to respond to
                    the challenges of the COVID-19 coronavirus. We all need to
                    take steps to keep ourselves and each other healthy and to
                    reduce the risk for spread of the virus. Information is
                    changing often, and updates will be made here regularly. You
                    should rely on official sources first and foremost. We will
                    repost some of that information here, in addition to BGCCV

                    As we monitor the rapidly evolving coronavirus (CVID-19)
                    issue, we are adhering to guidance from the Center for
                    Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health

                    Our national, state and local public health agencies are
                    confident that the best strategy to protect our population
                    from further spread of the virus is to practice healthy
                    behaviors, including frequent hand washing and
                    <b>Social Distancing</b>. The essence of Social Distancing
                    is that we avoid gatherings and maintain a physical distance
                    of approximately 6 feet from others when possible.

                                The virus is thought to be spread mainly from
                                person-to-person, by coming into close contact
                                with another person (within six feet) and
                                through respiratory droplets. These droplets are
                                produced when a person coughs or sneezes and
                                lands in the mouths or noses of people who are
                                nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The virus can also spread by coming in contact
                                with infected surfaces and objects. A person can
                                get the virus by touching a surface or object
                                which has the virus on it and then touching
                                their own eyes, nose, or mouth.

                                confirmed COVID-19 cases. Symptoms may appear

                                cough, and shortness of breath. People who are
                                mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to isolate at
                                home during their illness. You should restrict
                                activities outside your home, except for getting
