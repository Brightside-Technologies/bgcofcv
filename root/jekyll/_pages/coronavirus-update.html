 <p>Dear Friends:</p>
    <p>
        In an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus to
        protect our Club kids, employees and their families, Boys &
        Girls Clubs of Coachella Valley has closed the operation of
        our clubhouses in La Quinta, Indio, Coachella and Mecca
        until it is deemed safe to reopen.
    </p>
    <p>
        We were notified late in the afternoon on Friday, March 13
        that Riverside County Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron
        Kaiser has ordered the closure until April 3 of all
        Riverside County public schools, as well as preschools,
        charter schools, private schools and all colleges and
        universities in the county, to reduce the spread of the
        coronavirus.
        <b
            >So after careful deliberation, and in an abundance of
            caution, we are following suit, closing all four of our
            clubhouses based on the same timing as the school
            closures.</b
        >
    </p>
    <p>
        We recognize this decision will affect many people. We will
        continue to monitor this evolving issue and stand ready to
        re-open as soon as we can. Your patience is appreciated as
        we make every effort to communicate effectively and
        efficiently. We will share additional information as soon as
        it becomes available.
    </p>
    <p>
        As always, our focus remains on providing safe environments
        for local youth.
    </p>
